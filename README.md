# DIY Gamer Kit Infrared Library

This is an additional library for the [DIY Gamer Kit](https://www.techwillsaveus.com/shop/diy-kits/diy-gamer-kit-arduino/). It enables multiplayer game creation and communication over the infrared transmitter and receiver. 

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of **Arduino**. You can get this software [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

2. Open the Arduino software on your computer and navigate to **Sketch** → **Include Library** → **Manage Libraries...**

3. Type `Gamer` into the search bar. Two libraries should appear: **Gamer** and **GamerIR**.

4. Click on each library to highlight it and click the **Install** button. Do this for both libraries!

### Testing your installation

1. Open or restart the Arduino program (if it was already open)
2. Go to **File** → **Examples** → **GamerIR** and choose one of the example programs. `IRExample` is a great place to start.
3. Click on the **Verify** button to compile the example (the tick on the top left of the Arduino environment).

If the library hasn't been put in the right folder, you will get red errors saying something like `Symbol not found`. Make sure you have unzipped the library correctly and put it in the right folder.
